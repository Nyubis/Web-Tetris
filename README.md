Play the game [here](http://nyubis.github.com/Web-Tetris/)

A simple tetris clone made in HTML 5 and Javascript.
The HTML is limited to a basic canvas. All of the actual code is in the tetris.js file.

I followed the [Tetris Guideline](http://tetris.wikia.com/wiki/Tetris_Guideline) in some aspects, most notably the rotation system (SRS). I may make this game conform more to the guideline in the future.
